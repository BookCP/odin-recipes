#Odin recipe!

This project has really helped me to check myself and see what I've done right and what I haven't.
In this sense, I can say that I understand the HTML boilerplate, lists, links, images and what the structure of the project should be.
I still have a lot to learn, and probably need to spend some more time understanding commits and commit messages, but I think that will come with time.
I sometimes forgot to do a few things (like saving the files), but most things went pretty well.

This is the recipe HTML I created (I took the recipes from allrecipes.com) and tried to keep the format a bit.
When I added the pictures and chose the size, I did not take into account the aspect ratio, so the pictures look a bit stretched.
